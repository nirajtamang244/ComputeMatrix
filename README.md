## Matrix Calculator and Analyzer

Overview
The Matrix Calculator and Analyzer is a Python-based project that uses NumPy to perform common matrix operations. This project allows users to add, subtract, multiply, transpose, and invert matrices, as well as extract submatrices and compute their determinants. It's designed to help you understand array manipulations, vectorized operations, and slicing techniquesâ€”key concepts that also ease your transition into learning PyTorch.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations:**
  - **Addition:** Compute the sum of two matrices.
  - **Subtraction:** Compute the difference between two matrices.
  - **Multiplication:** Perform matrix multiplication using the dot product.
  - **Transposition:** Transpose a matrix.
  - **Inversion:** Invert a matrix with error handling for singular matrices.
  
- **Submatrix Extraction and Analysis:**
  - Extract submatrices using slicing.
  - Calculate the determinant of a submatrix.

- **Interactive Input:**
  - Option to use predefined matrices or input your own using a simple, text-based interface.
  - Custom input format: Enter rows separated by semicolons and elements by spaces (e.g., `1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9`).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
